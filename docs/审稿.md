This paper proposes a secure and efficient Isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) outsourcing framework which can address the privacy issues in outsourcing ISOMAP and validates the framework’s utility, security, and efficiency. The detailed design and evaluation of the framework are well written in this paper. 

There are some problems, which must be solved before it is considered for publication. Some sentences contain grammatical mistakes or are not complete sentences, such as, in page 2, INTRODUCTION, “Section VI conclude ” would be “Section VI concludes”. The author is expected to check the full text to avoid grammatical errors.

In page 1, ABSTRACT, this paper can start broad in the general background, then narrow in on the relevant topic that will be pursued in the paper, but the description of the subdivisions studied in this paper is not accurate enough. in page 2, INTRODUCTION, this paper introduces related research on privacy issues in dimensionality reduction tasks and its own scheme，but this is not very clear in the abstract. Maybe this part can be improved.

The figures in your paper are a bit blurry. Please replace the dot matrix diagram in the paper with vector diagram as much as possible, so it will appear clearer. And please adjust the position of the figures and tables so that the figures and tables are at the top of each page.
